# flatypus

ðŸ‘‹ hi, Iâ€™m Hinson, I'm a 15 year old developer based in Vancouver, Canada. 
* I mostly write code for small side projects in python or typescript that do nothing other than to make my life slightly easier or more interesting
* Sometimes my especially stupid ideas get their own youtube videos, so you should [definitely subscribe!](https://youtube.com/flatypus)
* You can reach me at flatypus#1423 on discord!

Some projects I've worked on: <br>

We made a low-cost headset that tracks your head with an arduino and allows you to play any game in VR! <br>
